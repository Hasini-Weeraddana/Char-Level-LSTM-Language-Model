# Char-Level-LSTM-Language-Model
### Use Case
This project demonstrates a character-level language model trained on Nietzsche's writings using an LSTM neural network. The model learns character sequences and generates new text that mimics the style and vocabulary of the input corpus. It serves as a foundational example for natural language generation (NLG) and can be extended for:
* Creative writing assistance
* Chatbot base models
* Poetic or philosophical text synthesis
* Educational demos for sequence modeling and RNNs
